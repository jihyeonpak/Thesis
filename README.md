#### Abstract: 
Background:
Bivalent oral rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) and oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV) are concurrently administered in low-income countries, and recent Polio Endgame strategies aim to replace all OPV and introduce inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) doses. This combination of Rotarix, OPV, and IPV has yet to be studied in low-income countries. 

Objectives:
(1) To investigate possible interference from concurrent administration of Rotarix with one IPV replacement dose in the trivalent OPV schedule (IPV-OPV) or without this replacement dose (OPV only) on OPV effectiveness among infants in Bangladesh at 52 weeks of life. (2) To descriptively compare mean treatment effect estimates from different statistical models and identify any potential differences in the model choices. 

Methods:
Between May 2011 and November 2014, 700 Bangladeshi infant-mother pairs from Dhaka, Bangladesh were enrolled into an open-label, randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design to compare Rotarix interference in infants who received an IPV replacement dose at 39 weeks (IPV-OPV) to infants who only received the trivalent OPV series (OPV only). One-hundred seventy-five infants were randomized to each of the four study arms: Rotarix with IPV-OPV, no Rotarix with IPV-OPV, Rotarix with OPV only, and no Rotarix with OPV only. The main comparison groups were no Rotarix with IPV-OPV and Rotarix with OPV only. The primary outcome was poliovirus immunity as measured by fecal excretion of any and all three shed poliovirus types up to 25 days post-52 week trivalent OPV dose. Adjusted generalized linear models (GLM) with a gaussian and Poisson log link functions (linear probability model and modified Poisson regression, respectively) as well as targeted maximum-likelihood estimation (TMLE) models were built to perform intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and estimate risk differences and risk ratios.

Results:
There were no meaningful differences in any shed poliovirus from the adjusted GLM and TMLE models among infants who received no Rotarix with IPV-OPV compared to infants who received Rotarix with OPV (RD: 0.0497; 95% CI: -0.06450.1638; P=0.3938). Relative risks were similarly null and nonsignificant between these two comparison groups (RR: 1.0683; 95% CI: 0.84031.3583; P=0.5896). Results for shedding analysis by each poliovirus type as well as comparisons across the other factorial groups who received different combinations of Rotarix, IPV-OPV, or OPV were similar. 

Conclusion:
This study’s analysis indicates that incorporation of IPV dose into OPV vaccination schedules is possible while maintaining OPV’s existing intestinal immunity, without any interference from concurrent Rotarix administration.
